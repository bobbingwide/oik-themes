## Frequently Asked Questions 

# Can I deliver bespoke themes? 
Can I deliver unique themes to my customer without having the themes listed on the website?

* Answer: Yes. You can have them listed as premium themes (themium) but don't associate them with a product.
No users will be able to purchase the product so only those with an API key and who already have the theme installed will be able to download the updates.
OR use Bespoke themes.

# How do I do this? 
One way of doing this:

1. create the product
2. create the theme attaching the product to the theme
3. buy the product
4. get an API key
5. unpublish the product
6. create the themium version
7. continue to create themium versions

only those users with API keys will be able to upgrade.

# Is there another way? 
Yes, classify the theme as "Bespoke"
This won't create a download button but the theme will be accessible if the user knows the theme name.
